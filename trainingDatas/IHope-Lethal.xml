<content>An astonishment, an engineering feat, and, finally, a folly.</content>

<content>It's only the latest indication that Christopher Nolan might be the slyest narrative tactician making movies today.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Pretty good, not bad, but brilliant it surely ain't.</content>

</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Nolan, like Cobb, is an assiduous extractor, and he knows how to wow audiences. But scaling big and thinking big are not the same thing. And dark, just because it's dark, isn't more artistic than light.</content>

<content>Quentin Tarantino seems to be hanging on to a lost world of moviemaking. He may be nuts. But he's a nut who cares.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Its biggest flaw, though, for those who care about such things, may be its moral attitude. That might seem a stodgy thing to bring up in the context of a Quentin Tarantino movie, but it takes such center stage that it needs to be examined.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Tarantino's vigorously accomplished 'Inglourious Basterds'</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Landa is such a wily and despicable concoction that, in movie terms, he's almost impossible not to like. And therein lies part of my problem with this movie.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>I'm tempted to say Tarantino has done it again, but I doubt anyone has ever done anything like his dazzlingly original World War II movie, Inglourious Basterds.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>It's these fine sequences that can make you truly regret Tarantino's snarky, in-joke impulses, not to mention his arrogant -- perhaps even dangerous -- lack of concern with the story's moral dimensions.</content>

<content>Will Basterds polarize audiences? That's a given. But for anyone professing true movie love, there's no resisting it.</content>

<item label="rotten">
<content>War reduced to pop entertainment should at least be easy to swallow, but this stuff keeps getting stuck in our craw. The trash that Tarantino used to elevate he now imitates.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Tarantino's signature nastiness and his juvenile delight in shocking the audience undercut the movie's larger purpose.</content>

<content>All the trademark Tarantino flourishes are here -- the joyous splaying of gore; the self-referential dialogue; the artful artificiality and the juxtaposition of humor and violence -- but they don't add up to much.</content>
</item>

<content>Simply another testament to his movie love. The problem is that by making the star attraction of his latest film a most delightful Nazi, one whose smooth talk is as lovingly presented as his murderous violence, Mr. Tarantino has polluted that love.</content>

<content>A coarse muddle of melodrama, romance and cautionary tale, the film is chiefly a tribute to throbbing Latin manhood, as cretinous and sophomoric as it is pretentiously surreal.</content>

<content>Screenwriter Moira Buffini sticks pretty closely to the novel, and director Cary Fukunaga conjures a drab tone that nicely sets off the characters' violent but rigidly controlled passions.</content>

<content>This is no plain Jane.</content>

<content>By opening their movie with the mature Jane, the filmmakers forge an emotional bond between her and the audience.</content>

<content>Cary Fukunaga's feverishly soulful remake of the multiply remade Jane Eyre rises to most challenges -- not the least of which is making Mia Wasikowska, a golden child of current cinema, look homely.</content>

<content>Luminous in The Kids are All Right and Alice in Wonderland, Wasikowska makes drab seem rad in director Cary Fukunaga's insightful rendering of Bronte's gothic love story, a new classic version of this oft-told tale.</content>

<content>Mia Wasikowska, from Australia, is a relative newcomer who must essentially carry \"Jane Eyre,\" and succeeds with restraint, expressing a strong moral compass.</content>

<content>A better barometer for the necessity of Cary Fukunaga's film, however, might be its less-than-literate box office competition. Applying that consideration, maybe we do need this Jane Eyre after all.</content>

<item label="fresh">
<content>What's so good about the movie is Gyllenhaal's refusal to show off; he doesn't seem jealous of the camera's attention when it goes to others and is content, for long stretches, to serve simply as a prism though which other young men can be observed.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Director Sam Mendes' third screen outing pretty well nails Swofford's tone, which was mordant without being disrespectful, and, in fact, is begrudgingly reverent of the Corps.</content>

<content>Jarhead makes its points less obviously than most war films, and with more brains than blood.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">

</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>The people you feel most badly for in Jarhead are not the men played by these talented actors, but the marketing department at Universal Pictures, saddled with the impossible task of selling a war movie that doesn't contain any actual war in it.</content>

<item label="fresh">
<content>I dare anyone to watch this bold exercise in postponed gratification and not come away with a new, disturbed sense of the genre.</content>

<content>Here's that J. Edgar Hoover biopic you asked for, or at least something that meets all the technical requirements to be considered one.</content>

</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>There are a couple of moments in Jerry Maguire when you want to hug yourself with delight.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Cameron Crowe's overstuffed but exuberantly humane Jerry Maguire is a Tom Cruise vehicle that gives equal time to brilliantly cast co-stars in elaborately conceived roles.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Cameron Crowe, Tom Cruise, and Cuba Gooding Jr. are salesmen, and we're consumers, buying emotional truth. That's a brave message for a commercial film to have. Too bad it's unintentional.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Zellweger's sweetly intense performance is a star-making one, while Gooding shines in his fast-talking charm.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Gooding does his finest work since Boyz N the Hood, positively glowing with this character's mixture of engaging brassiness and (occasionally misdirected) energy.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Jerry Maguire is a savvy depiction of a punched-up egomaniac being mauled by the tender hands of love.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Cruise is at the top of his form, and Gooding makes a brilliant opponent.</content>

<content>The grating sense of commercial calculation in Jersey Girl consistently undercuts Smith's fine writing.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Inspired by Smith's own awe and amazement at being a father, the movie is modest and entertaining, with a minimum of sentimental goo, and it demands little of us except a good-natured willingness to go with it.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>The filmmaker drowns his trademark edgy stew of smutty humor, stiff acting and dime-store insight into human nature with a gravy of glutinous bathos, making for a singularly unpalatable dish.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>This kind of weepy material works in the hands of melodrama masters like Douglas Sirk or Pedro Almodovar. But here, it's over-the-top and it's just horrible.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Smith is looking more and more like a developing major talent, so it could be years until we get a handle on this movie's legacy.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Watching Jersey Girl is akin to being smothered by a basket of warm puppies.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's saved by an unusually charming child actor: Castro, who has a voice like a pan flute and a sweetly low-key screen presence.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Smith is trying to say something heartfelt, even as he's using formulas that are unworthy of him. Thus, Jersey Girl is a step, not a misstep.</content>

<content>With Jersey Girl, [Smith] stopped fooling around, finally got his act together and made a real film. For once, he deserves the moniker 'filmmaker.'</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Sweet and conventional, with just enough wacky Kevin Smith moments to keep it going.</content>

<content>\"Part of Me\" succeeds because it's not afraid to let its big star be vulnerable.</content>

<content>This is a fantasy realm so fully and elegantly realized, it might be the adaptation of a classic novel. Yet the source is Del Toro's own capacious imagination.</content>
