<content>Now [Bay] hits new levels of both artistry and sleaziness in the black comedy Pain and Gain, which I strongly recommend if you don't overvalue taste, subtlety, and moral decency. I liked it.</content>

<content>This crude and ugly entertainment is as crass as everything this depressingly successful filmmaker has done.</content>

<content>It's official. Michael Bay, director of the Transformers clobberfests, knows how to make movies about humans, too. The problem is, he thinks humans are robots.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It may be the best movie Michael Bay's ever made. And suggests that, if you just kept his toys put away a little longer, someday he might even make a better one.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's like a giant sculpture that is so strange and off-putting, it's instantly, intriguingly post-modern. Swept up in the film's pile-driving self-assurance, even Bay-haters may absorb the pain to enjoy the gain.</content>

</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Alvart's cynicism about the current state of mankind helps make futuristic Pandorum interesting, but what makes it fun is his evident enthusiasm and talent for exploring the conventions of sci-fi films.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Director Christian Alvart and screenwriter Travis Malloy must have seen Aliens in the cradle, for they've digested it with love and delivered smart thrills that will please more than genre fans.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's a tight, minimalist Alien-esque \"something is loose and hunting people on our space ship\" picture that is as claustrophobic as you'd expect, if not quite as paranoid as you might hope.</content>

<content>Never averse to glistening darkness, meaty metaphor or grandiloquent technical display, Fincher is also surprisingly at home with hokum.</content>

</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>The movie is powerfully manipulative, quite clever and full of evil ambition.</content>

<content>It feels less like a suspense movie than a video-game spinoff of a suspense movie.</content>

<content>It's a triumph of technical filmmaking; as a story, it's got ice in its heart.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It might sometimes forget to make sense, but no matter, since it creates enough tension that the audience can hardly think anyway.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>The star of this movie is Fincher, who has filmed it in a grand style that manages to avoid showy excesses.</content>

</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Taut and forbidding, enough so that you won't mind the implausibilities.</content>

<item label="fresh">
<content>A better-than-adequate thriller that nevertheless is badly matched to director David Fincher's talents.</content>

<content>Guillermo del Toro has crafted a masterpiece, a terrifying, visually wondrous fairy tale for adults that blends fantasy and gloomy drama into one of the most magical films to come along in years.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>This is a fantasy realm so fully and elegantly realized, it might be the adaptation of a classic novel. Yet the source is Del Toro's own capacious imagination.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Pan's Labyrinth suggests that fairy-tale violence helps the vulnerable process and overcome real-life conflicts and that real-life violence permanently smashes the soul and the heart.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Del Toro specializes in taking horror and superhero films to bold, baroque places, yet Pan's Labyrinth is a step above his usual forays into the fantastic.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>So breathtaking in its artistic ambition, so technically accomplished, so morally expansive, so fully realized that it defies the usual critical blather. See it, and celebrate that rare occasion when a director has the audacity to commit cinema.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>A violent fantasy set during the Spanish Civil War, this magical film from Guillermo del Toro manages that intellectual high-mindedness, even as it resonates on a primal, mythic level.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It explores the connection between fantasy and reality, with eyes wide open to the dangers of giving either too much credence. That it works on both levels is impressive; that it makes them so clearly one is the stuff of art.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It is an adult fairy tale that will lead grown-ups to eagerly await the day that their own children will be old enough to understand.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>This backdrop of intrigue creates violent scenes that may have you turning away from the screen. Beautifully designed and full of its own strange poetry, Pan's Labyrinth is nonetheless not a children's movie. Take its 'R' rating seriously.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Ofelia, you break our hearts. But you also restore our confidence in human decency.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Pan's Labyrinth resembles a cross between Alice in Wonderland and H.P. Lovecraft, with some Bunuel thrown in for good measure. It's a tribute to -- as well as a prime example of -- the disturbing power of imagination.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>In coming up with one of the finest modern fantasies to date, del Toro seamlessly blends two stories, one set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and the other in a parallel realm of fairies and fauns.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Pan's Labyrinth is del Toro's home run. He's delivered a film full of power, beauty, horror and, ultimately, sadness.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Pan's Labyrinth is beautifully shot and designed, but it's the acting that makes it a remarkable emotional journey.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>The movie is that original, and that attuned to the power of myth. I don't see why it shouldn't sit on the same altar of High Fantasy as the Lord of the Rings trilogy -- it's that worthy.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Del Toro's gratifying surreal and fantastical instincts now have an unstinting moral eye on the world. Saying a filmmaker has matured suggests that he's forgone what made him so entertaining in the first place.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Pan's Labyrinth works on several levels. It boldly captures the horror of war, the bloody violence as well as the emotional stifling of the soul, and juxtaposes it with the enchantment of a nether land bathed in hope and eternity.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Pan's Labyrinth plays with dark magic, a hideous enchantment spun with grief and torment. It is emotionally devastating and sensuously rich: Details are as sharp as the ching of a straight-edge razor, as strange as the squeal of a magic root.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's pitch-perfect, impeccably conceived and replete with subtext and meaning. It is, in other words, a masterpiece.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>The dark violence of the film (parents, note: Pan's Labyrinth is not for children) is leavened by its invention -- by the way it pushes the limits of reality and fantasy, each world overlapping with the other.</content>

<content>The most that can be said for this strenuously bland reconstitution is that Steve Martin was clearly alive during filming. But just how alive, unfortunately, is at issue.</content>

<content>The Pink Panther is like a pratfall that doesn't work. It should be funny, but it hurts more than it should.</content>

<content>The Pink Panther, while hardly the disaster it might have been, renders the love as labored as the pronunciation.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>You can see that Martin knows what he's doing. He's still got plenty of comic game. Now all he needs is a more consistently funny comedy in which he can really let loose.</content>

<content>Paper Heart is like a really special five-minute YouTube clip that goes on for an hour and a half.</content>

<content>Even the most cynical are likely to be won over by the unassuming charms of Paper Heart.</content>

<content>But just as exciting -- maybe even more so, for those who love the medium and, especially, the uplift of the great-escape genre -- Rescue Dawn is a triumphant Werner Herzog movie.</content>

<content>Herzog builds this movie around another strong, eccentric performance from Bale, who is gaining a reputation for outsized talent and for downsized physicality.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's easy to understand why Herzog was driven to tell this story twice.</content>

<content>Perhaps if [director Herzog] had tossed in a few Chevys that transform into robots, the studio would have given him the cash to make Rescue Dawn definitive, instead of generic, which is the best he manages here.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>That heart-stopping beginning tells us Herzog is again in top form, richly depicting the true story of the only American POW known to have escaped from Laotian captivity.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Herzog shows all of this with a fresh, observant eye. While sadism is a staple of most POW movies, Herzog focuses on the punishing tedium and deprivation of confinement. And filming on location in Thailand gives the film a harshly sensual look.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>If Rescue Dawn isn't about heroism, then it's about something deeper, more primitive: survival instinct.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>If you're looking for a weekend movie that's heart-stoppingly suspenseful and inspiring, as well as brainy, funny, and strange, seek out Rescue Dawn.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>That such a masterful depiction of American heroism and can-do spirit has been created by a German art film director known for considerably darker visions of obsession is an irony Herzog no doubt finds delicious.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Like much of Herzog's work, it's essentially apolitical, focusing on a man at war with his environment -- and no one plunges into the foliage like he does.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>An odd but vivid and compelling mixture of big-movie showmanship and eccentric vision.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Herzog aims this genre effort at a broader audience than he usually gets, and he does so without losing his soul. It's a remarkably straightforward tale that allows the director to dwell on obsessions familiar to those who know his work.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Rescue Dawn avoids all the land mines inherent in most war movies. There's no hero worship; no noisy, confusing, special-effects-enhanced battle scene.</content>
