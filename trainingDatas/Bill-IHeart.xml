<content>A surprisingly tender look at San Diego Comic-Con...</content>

<content>\"Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope\" holds enormous appeal for both the geek audience and the casual viewer.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>There isn't a surprising moment, and it's an affirmation for hard-core fans and pretty much everyone else of William Shatner's immortal exhortation to Trekkies: \"Get a life!\"</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Rambling and scattershot, the film seems to be made expressly for the fans, not for a wider audience.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Written with Mr. Spurlock's frequent collaborator Jeremy Chilnick, the film is well organized and visually snazzy and keeps enough distance from its subject that you don't feel swamped in a tide of hysterical fandom.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Spurlock weaves together several story lines.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>\"A Fan's Hope\" is really for those who've turned to the far side, but is ready to turn on a tractor beam for everyone else.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>A tender, thoughtful paean to geek community.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Spurlock neither conveys the appeal of this world, nor does he ever, for one minute, stand outside the phenomenon and objectively examine it.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Most of the celebrity interviews offer more hype than insight. A carnival this immense hardly needs more barkers.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>\"A Fan's Hope\" is a look at the annual San Diego convention that is sweetly empathetic where previous Spurlock works have been brash and confrontational. Plus, it's a lot of fun.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>You won't appreciate the film fully unless you're already a member of the choir to which it's preaching.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Spurlock brings his usual good-humored approach to the subject, nicely balancing absurdity with genuine human interest.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>The film has less to do with politics, women's or otherwise, than with a very conventional notion of the redemptive power of mother love. Which would be all right if director Hal Ashby had managed to mount it effectively.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Coming Home is in general an excellent Hal Ashby film which illuminates the conflicting attitudes on the Vietnam debacle from the standpoint of three participants.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Slowly, disastrously, it reveals its true identity as a three-sided love story about two Vietnam veterans and the one woman who loves them both.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>The director is ... rather distracted; John Landis seems to be browsing through the scenes rather than gobbling them down.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Starts on a bathroom joke, quickly followed by a gag about private parts, then wanders in search of something equally original for Eddie Murphy to do for another couple of hours.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Superb comic timing, a satirical edge, and Murphy's extraordinary gift for mimicry lift it right out of the trough of mediocrity to which it is all but consigned by its utterly predictable storyline.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>A screenplay that seems to have escaped its doctors before it was entirely well.</content>

<content>The main pleasure in America comes in the romancing of prince and pauper. But the comedy is a mere handmaiden.</content>

<content>In Landis' hands, the film doesn't live up to even the meagerest of expectations.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>With a running time of nearly four hours, Cecil B. De Mille's last feature and most extravagant blockbuster is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects, but it isn't boring for a minute.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's the gigantic vulgarity, the obsessive righteousness of the director himself, which keeps the show on the road and suffuses the movie with its daft power.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>The crammed contents are linked ponderously in a long, warning movie sermon that has authority but little power.</content>

<content>The point of Compliance, which caused walkouts and shouting matches when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, is how we are programmed to do things that go against our natural instincts as long as we believe we have the law on our side.</content>

<content>This is one insistent film, more evocative of human behavior than movies that take fewer risks ever could be.</content>

<content>Like a John Hughes movie hijacked by Roman Polanski, this troubling indie effort lays bare the sadomasochism of the American workplace.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Zobel, a second-time feature filmmaker, has put together a skillful, sympathetic but unsparing re-enactment of a small-scale atrocity, and his cast plays it out with natural, understated performances.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Zobel's masterful direction and screenplay heighten the distress of authority figures possessing unseen persuasion over naive employees, exposing a disturbing and haunting look at what some workers are willing to do in order to follow orders.</content>

<content>There is a level of stupidity displayed by the people in this movie that beggars belief. Their behavior is to stupidity as the Death Star is to a doughnut.</content>

<item label="fresh">
<content>Compliance ends up being about certain things that it would rather not be about.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Ultimately what is fascinating about Compliance is its suggestion of the near-universality, and ultimate mundanity, of the totalitarian reflex.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's a deeply moral movie about the failure of morality, as grueling to watch as it is necessary.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Watching Compliance recently, I also began to squirm and talk back, but not because I disliked the movie, which I think is brilliant.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's a highly political work about how some people can be made to do vile things just for the wispiest promise that the powers above will go a little bit easier on them.</content>

<content>A silly little whodunnit that's a mild embarrassment to all involved.</content>
</item>

<content>Look, we know what's going to happen. The movie's called Temptation, okay? Yet we still have to sit through more than an hour of flirty glances and repetitive conversations between Judith and Harley until anything vaguely adulterous occurs.</content>
</item>

<content>Tyler Perry's Temptation is an awful, awful film and while it is easy to mock and dismiss, it is also kind of a shame to behold.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Limp pacing and countless shots of Washington's skyline plague the narrative.</content>

<content>There are so many good jokes packed in there.</content>

<content>The entire cast, in fact, seems to be having fun, with Affleck and Koechner cheerfully stealing each one of their scenes.</content>

<content>Mike Judge's Extract -- modest, no big deal but very savvy -- is the funniest American comedy of the summer.</content>

<content>Vera Farmiga makes a heavenly debut as a director with Higher Ground, a compelling drama about a woman's spiritual journey.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>The film's quiet realism demands from us our own act of faith: We're asked to watch closely and to listen intently in the promise of a greater reward to come. Well, the promise is partly kept.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Farmiga's first film is good enough to make us look forward to her next one.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>The film is refreshingly free of proselytizing. In its place, however, is a whiff of condescension.</content>
</item>

<content>At times, these analogies feel forced. But give the rookie filmmaker credit for visual storytelling.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Farmiga is terrific, but her clear vision as a director and her ability to play fair with believers and skeptics alike provides the balance and insight needed to ground the film in thoughtful reality.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>There's a gentleness to \"Higher Ground\" that's very appealing; you sense a real affection for all the characters, particularly the women, and a genuine curiosity about religion as a guiding principal in one's life.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>The film is ultimately a message movie about the virtue of independent thinking, offering plenty of small insights but no revelations.</content>

<item label="fresh">
<content>\"Higher Ground\" shines a light on an important aspect of the human experience, one not often explored onscreen, and contains a number of notable performances - not the least of which is Farmiga in the central role.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>In a world where believers and agnostics are polarized and hold simplified ideas about each other, it takes a step back and sees faith as a series of choices that should be freely made.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>The crucial thing about Higher Ground is that it takes at face value the faces, many bearded, almost all beatific, that the camera surveys -- quite an achievement, given Hollywood's woeful record in the dramatizing of faith.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Higher Ground is one of the few open-minded Hollywood movies about Christian fundamentalism, but the mind isn't sufficiently exploratory.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's a movie of glances, emotions that pass between characters - which the camera, and the other characters, sometimes inconveniently notice.</content>

<content>My kid went with it, and I had a fairly good time, as I waited for the reappearance of a marble-mouthed peasant tart, voiced by Jennifer Coolidge. Half the time her line readings are hilarious, and it's impossible to know why.</content>

<content>To convince you that it's full of surprises, the movie throws in Louis Prima songs where they don't belong, and it riffs on classic monster-movie cliches mostly by spinning them into newly unfunny cliches.</content>

<content>Igor tries to spoof Mary Shelley just as Shrek did the Brothers Grimm, but something tells us this movie's charmless hero won't make an ogre-size impression on kid audiences. Call it a hunch.</content>

<content>A potentially original premise and an eager voice cast led by John Cusack and Molly Shannon are left to decay amid a clunky story vaguely reminiscent of Monsters, Inc. and images often resembling visuals rejected from Tim Burton's Corpse Bride.</content>

<content>For I Hate Valentine's Day, Vardalos has chosen to direct. And that's a mistake that only compounds the ones in her screenplay.</content>

<content>The movie is set up as a valentine to Vardalos. She should try sending herself flowers.</content>

<content>You might blame Nora Ephron, whose screenplay for When Harry Met Sally established the formula that I Hate Valentine's Day runs into the ground. Compared with this, Ms. Ephron is Chekhov.</content>

<content>I Hate Valentine's Day is a horror show masquerading as a romantic comedy. Maybe Vardalos is just in the wrong line of work.</content>
