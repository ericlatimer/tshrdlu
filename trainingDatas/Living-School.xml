<content>A hip indie version of Truffaut's Day for Night, Living in Oblivion celebrates the very act of filmmaking as grand folly, a triumph of absurdist heroism.</content>

<content>Sean Penn gives a meticulously detailed performance as the cagey and charismatic pol, but credit should also go to Dustin Lance Black, whose script squarely locates Milk at the center of his community, his city, and his cause.</content>

<content>It is a whale of a comic tale, if also one overly crowded with characters and incidents.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Instead of this being a story of a bunch of lovely people doing a lovely thing, it's rather the story of average people who become much better people as a result of doing a lovely thing, even though some start out doing it for less than noble reasons.</content>

<content>Lee is a filmmaker who, through talent, accomplishment, and a constant working of the refs in the Hollywood system, has earned autonomy over his films. I'm all for artistic freedom, but here he could have used a bit of oversight.</content>

<content>It's impressive that a filmmaker of Lee's distinction is willing to continue to push boundaries.</content>

<content>The impulse here is to say something about the nobility of this movie's intent or to note that Spike Lee is one of our best filmmakers. But the first and most honest thing to say about Miracle at St. Anna is that it's an awful mess.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Ultimately, the film falters -- due to its length, some unconvincing European characters and too many turns that depend on sudden supernatural intervention.</content>

<content>The movie undeniably has its powerful moments, but it runs a crooked, crazy race moving from one to another, leaving the viewer both exhausted and frustrated.</content>

<content>'Mirror, Mirror' is a trippy version of the Snow White story.</content>

<item label="rotten">
<content>Mirror Mirror is a film that's all picture and no propulsion, each scene static in a basic set-decoration color scheme of teabag and banana.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Here, the familiar tale is retold with concessions to feminist self-determination and camp humor, bending the Grimm Brothers' tale without infringing on its basic beauty.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Singh is much more skilled as a visual artist than a storyteller, and his artistic fortunes seem to rise and fall with the inspiration of his screenwriters. In this case he's lucked out.</content>
</item>

<content>Who wants to see a fairy tale that weighs a ton? Mirror Mirror reflects badly on everyone involved.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>This rambling version of Snow White's tale is a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-coloured macarons and similarly devoid of substance.</content>

<item label="fresh">
<content>The dwarves provide wonderful fun, Singh's visuals have true magic and Alan Menken's score is charming.</content>

<content>Part of Mirror's problem is that the screenplay, credited to two writers and with a third getting a story credit, is all over the place.</content>

<content>Guillermo del Toro has crafted a masterpiece, a terrifying, visually wondrous fairy tale for adults that blends fantasy and gloomy drama into one of the most magical films to come along in years.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>This is a fantasy realm so fully and elegantly realized, it might be the adaptation of a classic novel. Yet the source is Del Toro's own capacious imagination.</content>
</item>

<content>A violent fantasy set during the Spanish Civil War, this magical film from Guillermo del Toro manages that intellectual high-mindedness, even as it resonates on a primal, mythic level.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It explores the connection between fantasy and reality, with eyes wide open to the dangers of giving either too much credence. That it works on both levels is impressive; that it makes them so clearly one is the stuff of art.</content>

<content>A CGI western comedy populated by desert critters, Rango gives the film year a belated jump start with a passel of movie-wise fun and a knockout animation style.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>With his first animated feature, Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski shows ambitions considerably beyond producing the usual standard of most children's fare. To put it plainly, Rango is one weird movie.</content>

<content>Rescue Dawn may not feel much like a Herzog movie, but it's a gripping real-life thriller.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>But just as exciting -- maybe even more so, for those who love the medium and, especially, the uplift of the great-escape genre -- Rescue Dawn is a triumphant Werner Herzog movie.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Herzog builds this movie around another strong, eccentric performance from Bale, who is gaining a reputation for outsized talent and for downsized physicality.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>It's easy to understand why Herzog was driven to tell this story twice.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Takes what could have been a mundane if well-made war story into something greater -- more harrowing, more hungry and more human.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>The performances here are as excellent as they are unnerving.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>... everything about Rescue Dawn feels real ...</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>Perhaps if [director Herzog] had tossed in a few Chevys that transform into robots, the studio would have given him the cash to make Rescue Dawn definitive, instead of generic, which is the best he manages here.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>That heart-stopping beginning tells us Herzog is again in top form, richly depicting the true story of the only American POW known to have escaped from Laotian captivity.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Herzog shows all of this with a fresh, observant eye. While sadism is a staple of most POW movies, Herzog focuses on the punishing tedium and deprivation of confinement. And filming on location in Thailand gives the film a harshly sensual look.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>If Rescue Dawn isn't about heroism, then it's about something deeper, more primitive: survival instinct.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>If you're looking for a weekend movie that's heart-stoppingly suspenseful and inspiring, as well as brainy, funny, and strange, seek out Rescue Dawn.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>That such a masterful depiction of American heroism and can-do spirit has been created by a German art film director known for considerably darker visions of obsession is an irony Herzog no doubt finds delicious.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Like much of Herzog's work, it's essentially apolitical, focusing on a man at war with his environment -- and no one plunges into the foliage like he does.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>An odd but vivid and compelling mixture of big-movie showmanship and eccentric vision.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Herzog aims this genre effort at a broader audience than he usually gets, and he does so without losing his soul. It's a remarkably straightforward tale that allows the director to dwell on obsessions familiar to those who know his work.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Rescue Dawn avoids all the land mines inherent in most war movies. There's no hero worship; no noisy, confusing, special-effects-enhanced battle scene.</content>
</item>
<item label="fresh">
<content>Herzog makes no attempt to pump this story up into a thrilling adventure. There is nothing thrilling about dysentery, starvation, insect bites and despair.</content>

<content>Schindler's List is a film whose meanings are to be found less in its uplifting outline than in its harrowing flow of images -- images of fear, hope, horror, compassion, degradation, chaos, and death.</content>

<content>Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again.</content>

<content>Schindler's List, despite blatant compromises, is a rending historical document.</content>
