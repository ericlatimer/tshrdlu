<item label="fresh">
<content>It's a classic situation, transplanted to a small, petty arena. When I think of this movie, I think of Oswalt, how his anguish feels real (whether we understand it or not) and how his face unaccountably becomes an offbeat locus of dignity.</content>

<content>I've seen comedies with fewer laughs than Body of Evidence, and this is a movie that isn't even trying to be funny.</content>

<content>Perhaps Scott's ever-restless shooting style doesn't quite differentiate between the peaks and troughs of the narrative, yet it's still an engrossing account of the intersection between process and ethics.</content>

<content>Good solid far-fetched multiplex action-adventure fare in the Bondian mode, with awe-inspiring technology and just enough moral philosophizing laced through it to give the mind a little something to chew on.</content>

<content>Just because it's really dense and layered doesn't mean it's good.</content>

<content>A complicated movie about the war on terror with two terrific performances and a terrific director.</content>

<content>DiCaprio's solid, though I wonder if a real CIA agent could get away with looking so earnest every second. Crowe has the right idea, in addition to all the fun: Just throw it away, throw it away and pretty soon you build yourself a clever characterization</content>

<content>Yes, there are a couple of chase scenes, but Scott rarely shifts into high gear.</content>

<content>A high-priced potboiler that never comes to a boil.</content>

<content>Its chief bid at seriousness, a confrontational colloquy with the top terrorist near the end of the film, comes across as the awkward regurgitation of a hastily swallowed subscription to The Economist.</content>

<content>It's a study in semisimilitude, more Google-Earthly than grounded in feelings.</content>

<content>The plot occasionally becomes convoluted and murky, but when it trains its focus on matters of treachery and intrigue, Body of Lies is exciting and compelling.</content>

<content>Body of Lies is more than anything a missed opportunity -- or perhaps, given its cellular phoniness, a series of missed connections.</content>

<content>I'm still waiting for the war-on-terror thriller that has more on its mind than the threat al-Qaida poses to movie stars.</content>

<content>Body of Lies is excessively intricate and extremely dull, the latest example of a filmmaker giving us a disjointed, overlong movie that's unnecessarily confusing to follow.</content>

<content>For those who care about there being more to a thriller than pointless car chases and over-edited fight sequences, Body of Lies offers a satisfying dose of truth.</content>

<content>Body of Lies is a riddle wrapped in an enigma served with a side of mystery meat. It's very watchable, with some entertaining action beats, kind of a Syriania as scripted by Tom Clancy, a The Kingdom with a little less C.S.I.</content>
</item>
<item label="rotten">
<content>It's a little bit of Syriana, a lot of Traitor -- and an awful lot of scenes of people cursing into cell phones.</content>

<content>Body of Lies is being hailed in some quarters as a 'new' kind of war thriller. While this glitzy production may attract audiences suffering from battle fatigue, it's nothing of the sort.</content>

<content>This film wants to have it both ways: to have a more urbane, more \"important\" scope than the original, and yet retain some of its inexpensive intimacy as well.</content>

<content>Kaufman here turns in his most Movie Brattish film, but soft-pedals on both his special effects and knowing in-jokiness in a way that puts De Palma to shame.</content>

<content>There's a little something extra in virtually every frame of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Philip Kaufman's dazzling remake of one of the cleverest of horror classics/</content>
